# ZeroThreeEngine

---

ZeroThree Engine is a game engine created by Steven Cheung at 18 years old. But ON HOLD for now, university got me very busy.

**Since I am attending KCL and trying to get that grade A, I am only able to work on this project when I have free time.**


**Update -> **

**13/01/2022 : Finding it hard to make time for this. Hard to gauge when this would be picked up again.**

**04/01/2024 : Studying for my masters so this is again taking a sabatical, will look to restart this, probably around during summer.**

ZeroThree Engine is in it's very early stages of development, having only completed a maths engine. Other aspects of the game engine would come in the future.
