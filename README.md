# ZeroThreeEngine

---

ZeroThree Engine is a game engine created by Steven Cheung at 18 years old. But ON HOLD for now, university got me wilding.

**Since I am attending university and trying to get that A, I am only able to work on this project when I have free time.**
**Update -> **
**13/1/22 : Finding it hard to make time for this. Hard to gauge when this would be picked up again.**

ZeroThree Engine is in it's very early stages of development, having only completed a maths engine. Other aspects of the game engine would come in the future.
